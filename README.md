# ofShaders #

As I work through the [openFrameworks shaders tutorial](http://openframeworks.cc/tutorials/graphics/shaders.html), I'll be uploading my own heavily commented shaders.

## 01_ColorMap ##

Same as the first example from the openFrameworks shaders tutorial.  This program draws a rectangle that covers the screen, and the fragment shader colors the pixels based on their position on the screen, generating a color map:

## 02_ConwaysGameOfLife ##

[Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) written to run in a shader:
